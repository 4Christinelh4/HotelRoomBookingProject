### Session management
Session is a logical connection between a server and a client. 
It persists over a period of time. 
When a user logs in the server, the server assigns a unique 
session identifier to the user. The user transfers the key when 
it makes requests to the server subsequently, before the 
session expires. 

In this project, `github.com/alexedwards/scs` is employed 
for session management.
